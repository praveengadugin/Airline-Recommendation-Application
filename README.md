# Airline-Recommendation-Application
Application for Airline recommendation

I had to build an app with both MariaDB clustering( Relational database) and MongoDB(NoSQL) for the same data and compare the performances ,advantageas and disadvantages.

I have used Nodejs as backend for this project


Airline Delay and Cancellation

Executive Summary
I have been tasked with creating an information system for an airline company. The data that we I am using for this project contains airline delay and cancellation times. 

I am using US domestic airline delays and cancellation data sets for 2017 and 2018 to analyze, interpret and derive business value from the source of flight delays. There are multiple reasons for flight delays ranging from carrier, weather, security and system delays. In-depth data analysis can help airlines unravel the real causes of flight delays and address them to avoid these in the future.

 I identify the airline that has maximum number of cancellations for a year due to airline or carrier problems so that the airline can upgrade their fleet of planes and train their staff accordingly to minimize cancellations and reduce costs of compensation. An important aspect of my analysis is also to identify departure airports with greater than 5000 flights taking off each year and having maximum average Taxi-Out time so that those airports can utilize integrated tower, airfield and gate systems to reach optimal operational efficiency which in turn will lead to increased airport capacity with existing airport infrastructure.
